    <h1>General Instructions</h1>
    <p>Please read these instructions carefully as we will ask you questions about them later.</p>
      <p>For this task we will give you a NOUN, and just below this noun, you will type out CREATIVE WORDS that are linked to the noun as they come to your mind.</p>
      <p>It is important that you are sitting in your normal typing position
      and that you type as you normally would as if you were taking notes or writing in a Word document.</p>

    <p>Take the opportunity to ready yourself now for typing. You will practice typing before any
      of the real tasks start.</p>

      <p>There will be 9 trials total with each trial lasting 2 minutes except the first trial,
        which is a practice trial and will last 30 seconds.
        You will be allowed to take a break between every trial, but remember,
        you have 45 minutes to complete this HIT.
        The tasks themselves will take no more than 18 minutes, including the short questionnaire at the end.</p>

        <p> Here is the flow of the experiment:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>1 practice trial</li>
      <li>8 experiment trials</li>
      <li>1 short demographic questionnaire</li>

      <h2>Task Instructions</h2>
        <p>Great job practicing. The real experimental trials start now!</p>
        <p>There will be Eight 2-minute experimental trials (~16 minutes). You can take short breaks in between each of the trials,
        but make sure you don't take too long a break so that you can finish in time.</p>
      <h3>Specific Instructions:</h3>
        <p>As you are aware, for this experiment we will give you a NOUN, and just below this noun,
        you will type out CREATIVE WORDS that are linked to the noun as they come to your mind.</p>
        <p>By creative, we mean words that are linked to the noun, but <b>very few, if any, other people would come up with.</b>
          So, that if someone else saw the response, <b>they would find it original and/or surprising, but still understand the connection.</b></p>
        <p><b>It is very important that you only type SINGLE WORDS</b>, that is, DO NOT type sentences or phrases.</p>
        <p>Each word will appear on the screen for 2 minutes. Use the entire time period to type the creative words you think of.
          Again, type each CREATIVE word as soon as it comes to your mind.</p>
        <p>The words can be any kind of word (verb, adjective, noun, adverb, etc.) <b>but they cannot be a proper noun</b>,
          so not a word that gets capitalized (e.g., Paul, Atlanta, Cheerios). Also, do not make up words, these should be real words.</p>
          <br>
        <p>When you are ready, click the button below to begin the first real trial. Start to type as soon as you think of something.</p>
